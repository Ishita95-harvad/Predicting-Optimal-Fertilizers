## Predicting Optimal Fertilizers
Here's a README file for your project, Predicting-Optimal-Fertilizers, which outlines its purpose, installation, usage, and more.


## Overview
Predicting-Optimal-Fertilizers is a machine learning-based project that helps farmers and agricultural experts determine the best fertilizer for crops based on various parameters such as soil type, weather conditions, and crop requirements.

## Features
- Data-driven fertilizer recommendations
- Soil analysis and prediction models
- Integration with weather conditions
- Easy-to-use interface for farmers

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Predicting-Optimal-Fertilizers.git
cd Predicting-Optimal-Fertilizers
pip install -r requirements.txt


Usage
- Prepare the dataset and ensure it's in the correct format.
- Run the prediction model:
python predict.py --input data/soil_data.csv


- The output will provide recommended fertilizers based on the input parameters.
Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas & NumPy
- TensorFlow (if using deep learning models)
